## Education

I am currently a first year masters student studying Biostatistics in Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. I was graduated from National Taiwan University in 2023 with a bachelor degree in Public Health.

My research experience includes working as a research assistant in the Taiwan Lung Cancer Society from 2024 to 2025. I was involved in a nationwide non-smoking lung cancer prospective study, where I utilized R and SAS for data cleansing, multivariate regression analysis and visualizing results.
